# Searching-and-Sorting-Techniques


## => Selection Sort :
#### **select** the first element as the minimumNumber in the unsorted array , compare it with second element, if it smaller then the minimumNumber then swap with it, if not move to another element and check same for it, repeat it till n-1 elements of the array. At last, All the array will be sorted in increasing order.
- Time Complexity : O(n^2)
- Space Complexity : O(1)

## => Bubble Sort :
#### Repeatedly compare the adjacent elements ,if arr[j]>arr[j+1] swap them. The maximum element **bubbles** up to the end of the unsorted array. After n-1 iterations, we get sorted array.
- Time Complexity : O(n^2)
- Space Complexity : O(1)
